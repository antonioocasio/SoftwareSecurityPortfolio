# Software Security Portfolio

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial company that wanted to implement software witht the newest and most secure security solutions and protocols. 

### What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I believe that I developed a checksum verification file properly and sucessfully ran a maven dependency check to check the overall integrity of the program. 

### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The most difficult part of this was reviewing the vulnerabilites that I found using the maven depenedency check. 

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
The was that I approached the layers of security was by making sure that everything had a secure connection so that the program was only viewable between Artimis and the customer. The strategy that I plan on using in the future is maven depenedency checks. 

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
THe way that I made sure the application was secure and functional was by running tests and trying to see if is was possible to break the program. 

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The most helpful tool that I used was the maven dependency check since this checks for the weakness of a program. 

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would show employers previous software that I have developed and how I met the requirements of that program which shows that I can follow the instructions clearly.
